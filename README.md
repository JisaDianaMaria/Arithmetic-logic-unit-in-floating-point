Arithmetic-logic unit in floating point - VHDL

The main purpose of this project is to develop and implement a specialized Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) to perform addition and subtraction operations on 32-bit floating-point numbers. This ALU will maintain compliance with the IEEE standard but will be adjusted to provide single precision suitable for less complex applications.
