# Arithmetic-logic unit in floating point 

__CONTEXT__

The main purpose of this project is to develop and implement a specialized Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) to perform addition and subtraction operations on 32-bit floating-point numbers. This ALU will maintain compliance with the IEEE standard but will be adjusted to provide single precision suitable for less complex applications.

__SPECIFICATIONS__

To ensure this functionality, the data entered from the keyboard will initially be in binary format. During the processing stage, this data will be converted into the appropriate format for floating-point operations according to the IEEE-754 Single Precision standard, which defines numbers on 32 bits divided into three components: mantissa, exponent, and the sign bit, with lengths of 23, 8, and 1 bit, respectively. After performing these operations, the result will be transformed back into binary format. This bidirectional conversion facilitates the input and interpretation of data, contributing to the efficiency and accessibility of the entire process.
